## Usage

### Basic Report Generation

```python
from backend.report.report_generator import ProfessionalReportGenerator

# Initialize report generator
generator = ProfessionalReportGenerator()

# Generate comprehensive report
report = generator.generate_comprehensive_report("192.168.1.100")

# Access generated files
print(f"HTML Report: {report['html_path']}")
print(f"PDF Report: {report['pdf_path']}")
print(f"Executive Summary: {report['executive_summary_path']}")
```

### CrewAI Agent Integration

```python
from backend.agents.enhanced_report_crew import EnhancedReportGeneratorCrew

# Initialize enhanced crew
crew = EnhancedReportGeneratorCrew("./data")

# Generate professional analysis
analysis = crew.generate_professional_report("192.168.1.100")

# Access detailed metrics
metrics = crew.calculate_security_metrics(assessment_data)
business_impact = crew.assess_business_impact(metrics, assessment_data)
```

## Report Components

### Executive Summary
- **Risk Level Assessment**: Critical, High, Medium, Low classifications
- **Business Impact**: Financial estimates, operational impact, compliance risks
- **Key Metrics**: Vulnerability counts, exploit success rates, risk scores
- **Immediate Actions**: Priority-based remediation recommendations

### Technical Analysis
- **Vulnerability Details**: CVE analysis with CVSS scoring
- **Network Services**: Port scan results and service identification
- **Exploitation Results**: PoC execution results and evidence
- **Remediation Guidance**: Technical implementation steps

### Compliance Assessment
- **Regulatory Mapping**: NIST, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, GDPR alignment
- **Gap Analysis**: Identified compliance deficiencies
- **Audit Readiness**: Documentation and evidence requirements

## Data Sources

The system automatically processes JSON files from various assessment steps:

### Network Scanning
```json
{
  "target_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "open_ports": [
    {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "TCP",
      "service": "http",
      "product": "Apache",
      "version": "2.4.41"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Vulnerability Analysis
```json
{
  "identified_cves": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-1234",
      "severity": "critical",
      "cvss_score": 9.8,
      "affected_service": "Apache HTTP Server",
      "exploit_available": true,
      "description": "Remote code execution vulnerability"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Exploitation Results
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-1234",
      "success": true,
      "exploit_command": "exploit/multi/http/apache_rce",
      "evidence": "Command execution successful"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# CrewAI Configuration

   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. **PDF Generation Failures**
   ```bash
   # Install WeasyPrint dependencies
   pip install weasyprint
   # Or use text-based fallback (automatic)
   ```

3. **Missing JSON Data Files**
   ```python
   # Ensure assessment JSON files exist in data directory
   ls ./data/{target_ip}_*.json
   ```
