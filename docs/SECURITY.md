# Security Considerations

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**BreachPilot is designed for educational and authorized testing purposes only.**

- Only use on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test
- Unauthorized scanning may violate laws and regulations
- Users are responsible for compliance with applicable laws
- The developers assume no liability for misuse

## Security Features

### Human-in-the-Loop Design

BreachPilot implements multiple safety mechanisms:

#### 1. CVE Approval Required
- All vulnerability candidates require explicit user approval
- Default response is "No" to prevent accidental approval
- Clear display of CVE information before approval

#### 2. No Automatic Exploitation
- BreachPilot does **NOT** automatically execute exploits
- Tool focuses on identification and assessment
- Any PoC execution requires explicit user confirmation

#### 3. Comprehensive Logging
- All actions and decisions are logged
- User approvals/denials are recorded
- Full audit trail for accountability

#### 4. Educational Focus
- Reports emphasize learning and understanding
- Includes remediation guidance
- Promotes responsible security practices

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Network Isolation
```bash
# Recommended: Use isolated test networks
# Example VMware setup:
# - Host-only network
# - No internet access for targets
# - Controlled environment
```

### 2. Permission Management
```bash
# Document authorization
echo "Authorized by: [Name]" >> scan_authorization.txt
echo "Date: $(date)" >> scan_authorization.txt
echo "Scope: [IP ranges]" >> scan_authorization.txt
```

### 3. Safe Defaults
- Minimal scan intensity by default
- Conservative timeouts
- Limited concurrent connections
- No aggressive scanning options

## Compliance Considerations

### Legal Requirements
- **Authorization**: Written permission required
- **Scope**: Clearly defined target scope
- **Timing**: Agreed testing windows
- **Reporting**: Secure handling of findings

### Industry Standards
- **OWASP**: Follows testing guidelines
- **NIST**: Aligned with cybersecurity framework
- **ISO 27001**: Supports security management
- **PCI DSS**: Compatible with security testing requirements
