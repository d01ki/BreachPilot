# Attack Scenario Generation - Arsenal Feature

## Overview

BreachPilot now includes **automated attack scenario generation** - a cutting-edge feature that transforms reconnaissance data into executable attack chains. This feature is designed for Black Hat Arsenal demonstration.

## Key Features

### 1. Attack Graph Builder
**Transforms scattered reconnaissance data into structured attack graphs**

- **Input**: Nmap results, CVE analysis, service fingerprints
- **Processing**: Creates nodes for hosts, services, vulnerabilities, access points
- **Output**: Interactive attack graph with:
  - Entry points identification
  - High-value targets
  - Attack path analysis
  - Exploitability scoring

### 2. Scenario Generator
**Generates feasible attack scenarios using LLM + rule-based approach**

**Built-in Scenario Templates**:
- Direct Vulnerability Exploitation
- SMB Relay Attack
- Kerberoasting
- Multi-Step Privilege Escalation

### 3. PoC Synthesizer
**Automatically generates executable PoC code from scenarios**

### 4. Sandbox Executor
**Safe execution environment with strict safety controls**

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
**Expert review before execution**

## Novelty & Differentiation

### What Makes This Arsenal-Worthy?

1. **End-to-End Automation**: Recon â†’ Graph â†’ Scenarios â†’ PoCs â†’ Execution
2. **Quantitative Assessment**: Success probabilities, time estimates, risk scoring
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Safety-first design with mandatory approval
4. **Reproducibility**: Synthesized PoCs can be saved and reused
5. **MITRE Mapping**: Clear attribution to ATT&CK techniques
6. **Sandbox Isolation**: Safe execution environment

## Safety & Legal

ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: You MUST have explicit written authorization before using BreachPilot.
